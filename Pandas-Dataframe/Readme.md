# DataFrame

In Pandas, a DataFrame is a fundamental data structure used for handling tabular data, similar to a table in a relational database. It is a two-dimensional labelled data structure with rows and columns, each of which can have a different data type such as numeric, string, boolean, etc.

Here's an example of a DataFrame representing some geographical data:

|   | State | Geographical Area (sq Km) | Area under Very Dense Forests (sq Km) |
|---|-------|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1 | Assam | 78438                     | 2797                                    |
| 2 | Delhi | 1483                      | 6.72                                    |
| 3 | Kerala| 38852                     | 1663                                    |

In this DataFrame:

- **Row Indexes**: Each row has an index (in this case, numerical indices starting from 1).
- **Columns**: The DataFrame has multiple columns, each with a specific label and corresponding data.
- **Data Types**: Columns can contain different types of data, such as integers, floats, strings, etc.

DataFrames provide powerful functionalities for data manipulation, analysis, and exploration. They offer methods for indexing, slicing, merging, aggregating, and filtering data, making them a versatile tool for handling structured data in Python.
